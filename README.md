🛒 Online Shopping Cart (GUI Based)

📘 Project Description

The Online Shopping Cart is a Java Swing-based desktop application that simulates a real-world shopping cart system.
Users can browse items, add them to the cart, update quantities, remove items, and view total prices. The system uses MySQL via JDBC to store item and cart data securely, demonstrating GUI development, event-driven programming, and database integration.
